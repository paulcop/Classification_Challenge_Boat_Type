# Classification Challenge Boat Type

## Description

This notebook showcases my participation in a deep learning competition focused on classifying various types of boats. Using a convolutional neural network inspired by the VGG16 model, I achieved 2nd place among participants from four different academic backgrounds.

## Model Features

* **Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Network with multiple layers including `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `BatchNormalization`, and `Dropout`.
* **Libraries used**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used for this competition is stored in the `dataset` folder and contains images of various types of boats.

## How to View the Notebook

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Mael-221/Boat-Type-Classification-Challenge.git
   ```
2. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it with:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```
3. Navigate to the repo folder and launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the notebook through the Jupyter interface to view and run it.

## Dependency Installation

To install all required dependencies to run the notebook, use the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results

The model was trained and validated on the dataset, with plots showing the loss and accuracy for both training and validation. Additionally, a confusion matrix was generated to visualize the model’s performance on the validation set.
